To load a scroll, click on a link on the side if you're on a computer or top if you're on mobile.  To edit a scroll, click the edit link which looks like this:

To copy a scroll from one server to another, open the edit screen in the source server, click on the scroll to copy, then select the whole window(being careful not to delete it) and copy it to the clipboard.  Then enter the name of the new scroll in the editor on the destination server, and paste the text into the edit screen and click the scroll link to go to the reader, then you should see your new scroll in the list of scrolls, and you can click on it and read it.  You can then go back and edit your new local copy of the scroll, and it can be replicated on to new destination servers from there, evolving and replicating across the Geometron Network.  

To make a button which can load another scroll, copy this code and replace the text with your text and the scroll name between the "div" tags and the code which says "scrolls/pisetup.md" with your scroll name.

<div class = "button" onclick = "loadscroll(&#34scrolls/pisetup.md&#34)">LOAD RASPBERRY PI SETUP SCROLL</div>

<div class = "button" onclick = "loadscroll(&#34scrolls/pireplicate.md&#34)">LOAD RASPBERRY PI REPLICATOR SCROLL</div>

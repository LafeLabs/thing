# Trash Robot Scroll!

To create a scroll, write a text article and send it to the Operator to publish, along with the name of the Scroll.  Scrolls are just text files, in [Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

To see a scroll, enter the address of it(can be either global or local) of it into the pink box.

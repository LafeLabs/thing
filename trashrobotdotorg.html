    <h1>Trash Robot</h1>

<p>
  Dig it up, set it on fire, and bury it. This is our civilization in a nutshell. The way to break this cycles is to build technology which is both made from waste streams and which can manufacture products using waste streams. Trash Robot is a robot built from trash which is programmed to print patterns in clay. We program it using Geometron, a symbolic language based on geometry and designed to make it simpler for non-experts to control machines while avoiding numbers and code. Together we, the people of Trash Robot, will give FREE robots to every artist, student, or maker in the world.
</p>
<p>
We are asking YOU to join this movement now and scale Trash Robot to the whole world!

<h2 id = "librarians">Librarians</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
     Store kits in the library maker spaces for distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reach out to populations under-served by normal STEAM education programs to give them free robots.
    </li>
    <li>
    Add trash robot to educational programming for the library, to help bring library patrons in as artists, students, and hobbyists.  Teachers in the network can be called upon to lead classes in how to set it and run it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Take donations from donors, be the tax deductible non profit or guide donors to one which will allow them both to buy components and donate surplus equipment(namely DVD and CD drives)
    </li>
    <li>
    Serve as a trusted intermediary between parents, hobbyists, donors, and teachers. For safety reasons it makes sense for parents to trust public libraries as a resource for free information and materials, and providing that sense of security is important. Donors need to know they're contributing to a real organization as well if they're to trust that a donation will end up at the right place.        
    </li>
    <li>
        Help spread the word to the rest of the library community
    </li>
    <li>
    If you run a "little free library" that counts! You can use that as a place out of the rain where people can leave and take parts for kits, fully assembled robots, and completed clay tablets to share with the community.    
    </li>
    <li>
        University libraries have similar roles to play to other libraries, but what we hope for from them in Trash Robot is that public study lounges can serve as a place where robot materials can be shared. If this has the support of library staff, who can help find volunteers to run a robot production zone in a study lounge, it can be very useful.

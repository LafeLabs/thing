    <h1>Trash Robot</h1>

<p>
  Dig it up, set it on fire, and bury it. This is our civilization in a nutshell. The way to break this cycles is to build technology which is both made from waste streams and which can manufacture products using waste streams. Trash Robot is a robot built from trash which is programmed to print patterns in clay. We program it using Geometron, a symbolic language based on geometry and designed to make it simpler for non-experts to control machines while avoiding numbers and code. Together we, the people of Trash Robot, will give FREE robots to every artist, student, or maker in the world.
</p>
<p>
We are asking YOU to join this movement now and scale Trash Robot to the whole world!

<h2 id = "librarians">Librarians</h2>

<p>
    Librarians!! you are the connectors that link this network together. You already serve a role in communities across the world to share information and resources locally across all ages and sections of society. You can treat this like any other programming that would normally be part of a makerspace or other STEAM education and outreach you might have.   More specifically we need you to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
     Store kits in the library maker spaces for distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reach out to populations under-served by normal STEAM education programs to give them free robots.
    </li>
    <li>
    Add trash robot to educational programming for the library, to help bring library patrons in as artists, students, and hobbyists.  Teachers in the network can be called upon to lead classes in how to set it and run it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Take donations from donors, be the tax deductible non profit or guide donors to one which will allow them both to buy components and donate surplus equipment(namely DVD and CD drives)
    </li>
    <li>
    Serve as a trusted intermediary between parents, hobbyists, donors, and teachers. For safety reasons it makes sense for parents to trust public libraries as a resource for free information and materials, and providing that sense of security is important. Donors need to know they're contributing to a real organization as well if they're to trust that a donation will end up at the right place.        
    </li>
    <li>
        Help spread the word to the rest of the library community
    </li>
    <li>
    If you run a "little free library" that counts! You can use that as a place out of the rain where people can leave and take parts for kits, fully assembled robots, and completed clay tablets to share with the community.    
    </li>
    <li>
        University libraries have similar roles to play to other libraries, but what we hope for from them in Trash Robot is that public study lounges can serve as a place where robot materials can be shared. If this has the support of library staff, who can help find volunteers to run a robot production zone in a study lounge, it can be very useful.
    </li>
</ul>
    
<h2 id = "makers">Makers</h2>

<p>Trash Robot is a totally decentralized industrial production swarm. For this to work we need to build a vast network of people with the knowhow to replicate the whole system. We need people with crafting skills(cardboard and plastic trash) and basic electronics assembly(simple soldering), as well as people who like to take things apart and scavenge for parts.  If you are one of these but not the others, you can form a network to build collaboratively(cardboard crafters can find elecronics builders and vice versa).  
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Build robots!</li>
    <li>Teach others to build robots</li>
    <li>Share kits with other makers</li>
    <li>Reach out to librarians and teachers to donate robots that can get directly to kids</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "students">Students and Artists</h2>
<p>
    Students and artists! You are the operators who make the final product of the whole Trash Robot system. What you can do is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Find someone to give you a robot and get it set up(teacher, librarian, or maker)</li>
    <li>Make your own symbols and share them with others, build a culture of remixing the art made with Trash Robot</li>
    <li>Make finished clay tablets from Sculpey and distribute, exchange, display or sell them</li>
    <li>Learn to build robots yourself and become a maker</li>
    <li>Learn to teach others how to set up the system and become a teacher</li>
    <li>Learn the Geometron langauge and use it to make new fonts, symbolic systems, and apps to share with others</li>
    <li>Make custom unique gift items for others using the clay tablet fabrication</li>
</ul>

# Install Geometron on Raspberry Pi

Set up a Raspberry Pi.  To learn more about Raspberry Pi see the main page at [www.raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and also look at what is available on [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) in terms of Raspberry Pi stuff, as well as [https://www.sunfounder.com/](https://www.sunfounder.com/) and [https://www.pishop.us/](https://www.pishop.us/).  How much stuff you need to get depends on how you want to use the server.  

Servers are packaged with cardboard, rainbow colored duct tape, and sheets of HDPE from milk bottles.  They should have tie holes where Trash Ties can be used to suspend them.

### Components of a full Raspberry Pi system:

 - HDMI screen
 - HDMI cable
 - Raspberry Pi board
 - SD card
 - SD card reader/writer
 - USB keyboard
 - USB mouse
 - Wall plug
 - Rechargeable battery

Keyboards should be painted with the Geometron Symbol glyphs using the following map:

When you have gathered the parts, assemble them, install NOOBS on the SD card, and set up your pi.  This collection of highly portable elements including the rechargeable battery is important for the portability of the system, which should have a dedicated bag to carry it around in so that it is fully mobile.  

[link to set up the Pi from raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md)

Open a terminal and install Apache and php:

<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
</pre>

Then install the [Geometron software](https://github.com/lafelabs/thing/) type copy/paste these commands into the terminal:

<pre style = "overflow:scroll">
cd /var/www/html
sudo rm index.html
sudo curl -o replicator.php https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/thing/master/php/replicator.txt
cd ..
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
cd html
php replicator.php
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
</pre>

That Raspberry Pi is now set up to act as a Geometron server.  Log that Pi onto a local wifi hotspot, then go to the link at the top of the screen to get a QR code and link for that server.

# Geometron

## Poetry Engine

The first thing to do in Geometron is to learn to operate the Poetry Engine.  The poetry engine points to any image on the World Wide Web and adds meaning to it with words placed over the image like magnets on a refrigerator.  This is a tool to impose meaning on any kind of "thing" in the most abstract possible sense, and to instantly transmit that meaning to any other person in the world.  

[click on this link to go to the poetry engine at poetryengine.html](poetryengine.html)

Now find an image on the Web and copy the link.  This is easiest to do by choosing something that comes to mind that you want to think about, look it up on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), and then right clicking an image in the article that you like. When you right click an image you can select "copy image location", then go back to the browser with the Poetry Engine in it and enter that image url in the field marked "image url".  The image should instantly change to the one you selected. Now save that as the new image by clicking the save icon which is a box and a down arrow.  Now drag the mouse or slide a finger on the touch screen on the image to move words around.  Use the next and previous buttons with lines and arrows to move through the words or up and down arrows if you're using a keyboard and have the cursor in the "text" input.  Change the text and hit "enter", and save again.  Now move words around and edit them until you have created a meaning for the image.  


Save again, and notice that the larger text box is filled with [strange looking code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).  Now copy all that code to the clipboard and paste it into an email or text message to another Geometron user.  They can then paste that code into the same field and click the "IMPORT" button in the very lower right corner of their screen and it will load the whole of your poem to their screen.  Ask them to send back one to you and you can import it in the same way, edit it, and send it back.  

To get back to this page, click on the scroll symbol, the left-most icon in the row of icons.

## Quantum Duality

From fundamental computer science to politics to gender, the binary models of understanding the Universe are failing.  In Quantum Duality is a philosophy engine in which we address the failures of these old numerical ideas by directly interacting with duality based on pairs of stacked images with varying opacity, which are lined up, scaled and rotated.  The math which determines the opacity of each image is identical to that of quantum superposition.  

In the quantum duality we find two images on the Web, put both links into the duality page, move them around, rotate them, scale them, and then experience the duality of them by sliding a pointer or finger on a touch screen sideways across the screen.

[Click this link to go to the quantum duality app](duality.html)

As in the Poetry Engine, copy-paste images from around the Web, such as from Wikipedia, into the image url inputs.  When you hit "enter" the image should replace the existing one.  Click the "save" icon to save the new duality.  Click the "top" or "bottom" button to select the top or bottom image.  Click "duality" to go back to duality mode.  Move a finger or drag a cursor around to move an image.   Slide a finger or drag a pointer across the scale or rotate bars to re-scale or rotate an image.  Click "save" again to save.  When you click "save" copy the text from the text area in the lower right hand corner of the screen, and text or email that to another Geometron user, who can then paste the code in the same text area and hit the "import" button to see it.  They can then interact with the duality, save a local copy, edit it, and re-export it to remix and share. 

## Marker

Markers are how we link the physical environment around us to Geometron.  They can be anything, but for the time being they will be geometric symbols painted on found objects like rocks or trash and placed outside in a public space which has some sort of local geographic meaning.  Markers form the geographic syntax of Geometron.  

In Geometron geography is divided into two spheres: the Watershed and the Street.  Wherever you are, you got there somehow, as did all the technological artifacts you use and are surrounded by.  The fractal structure by which you and your things got there is the Street.  It includes literal roads, highways, and streets in addition to more abstract supply chains and other means of transport like stairs, ramps, shipping lanes at sea and rail lines.  

Also, 

Place painted rock in a location, photograph the rock in that place, upload that photograph to imgur, get the raw image url, and post that in the background of [the marker wall app at wall.html](wall.html).

## Scrolls

Create a new scroll, edit it, paste it, share it, let other edit, how to do math papers, link to srs scroll

## maps

Maps, memes, powerpoint, and the universal linked graphical document. Use of imgur for universal urls. Make a meme and share it, using universal urls, just like in previous systems.

## Decks
 
Stacks of maps, philosophy of watershed and street.  Make laminated maps of "here" in both street and watershed.  Put each one on imgur.  Make painted rocks and place them on maps, use to mark the marker created in the wall action above.  go make more markers and share them, build a deck as a stack of maps, then share that with someone, save it to pastebin

## Build a web page on index.html

links to learn all the types of code, to how code fits together, the 5 alchemy elements of geometron code, how editor.php works.  At minimum, though, just make a link to something 


## Action Geometry

use the laser cut shapes to copy the book

note all the symmetry and scale glyphs in text, lead into glyphs for moving and drawing

use the book to bind another blank book, make another book sewing kit

## Symbol App

[symbol app link](symbolapp.html)

edit symbols and share them with other users via text message and email, copy glyphs and symbols with screen shots

## build a keyboard, tablets, hypercube

Understand the hypercube, ASCII, and the GVM.

edit keyboard, paint keyboard, use to make icons and symbols, learn about the hypercube, edit one and share it with others, share all elements created, share keyboard, buy new keyboard, print and laminate tablets: 

- 00 - 037: root magick
- 040-0176:ASCII
- 0177: do nothing
- 0200-0277: shapes
- 0300-0377: 2d geometry actions
- 0400-0477: machine actions
- 0500-0577: machine shapes
- 0600-0677: 3d shapes
- 0700-0777: 3d geometry actions
- 01000-01777: symbols for 0-0777(second cube)

## build your own laser cut shapes

Use main geometron editor to create shapes, both svg and png, save, email to someone with laser cutter(or ponoko) and get shapes, more than you need, give them to people, including whoever sent you the system

## symbol app builder

build a new symbol app with custom symbolic language, custom mobile interface, custom keyboard, share symbol app with other users, along with symbols

## make patterns in clay

set up the robot, connect it all, edit the code, or have someone else set it all up and test it all.  When totally set up by someone else, put soft modeling clay on build stage, flatten it, and use a nail to make simple patterns and write words.  Copy code and share with other users, send code of symbol to whoever sent you the system.  Repeat with sculpey, bake, and paint, then share the tablets with whoever sent you the system and also whoever you're sending new systems to

## Build your own language in the clay

edit machine-specific hypercube, document it, share it, use it to make 3d objects

## Build a new robot and share it with others

- gather wires, connectors, pcb's, pi parts, cardboard, box cutter, glue and tape, plastic sheet, magnets, nails, salvaged buttons, lipo battery, pi screen and periferals
- find dvd drives, take them apart, solder wires on
- assemble probe with cardboard, epoxy, tape, plastic, probe, electronics, pi
- edit the code to make it work, test it out, set it up, repeat all tests, share it with someone else

## build a localhost instance, link to github

## Build an instance on a free or paid web host

## Improve the system and replicate it

What you see in the edit screen(after clicking the edit icon) here is "markdown", which is language which allows people to publish things on the web without learning more complex languages. Hit return twice to get a paragraph break.  Copy the syntax you see here to get links and images and headings. You can look up markdown ([cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), [detailed guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) for more syntax.  Also embedding <span style = "color:red;font-family:courier;">HTML</span> works if you know that.  

[Geometron Symbols](symbol/): 

[![](iconsymbols/geometron.svg)](symbol.html)

[Create a fork](fork.html):

[![](iconsymbols/fork.svg)](fork.html)

Enter the name of the new page you want to create and click through the links to get to a new page one level down from this one.  Repeat this in the "new map" field to make a new map, which is a stack of images, symbols, words and links in a general web page layout.  Each Geometron page has a scroll and a map.  The "main" page can be either a scroll or map.  To see the map, click on its symbol, and to edit it click the edit icon from the map screen. The default map shows what the symbols mean that are used for editing.  To see the current map value go to [data/currentmap.txt](data/currentmap.txt).  Also, this JSON file can be edited directly using editor.php(see link below).  Inventory is used to track inventory at a given factory or page.  

[Map](map.html):

[![](iconsymbols/map.svg)](map.html)

Maps are a stack of web elements(images, symbols, words, links) arranged geometrically on a page.  The Map page contains an editor for adding and deleting elements, moving them around, rotating them, changing their images, symbols, words and links and changing the order in which they are stacked.  Click the edit button in the map page to edit it. Most pages in the Geometron Art Factory system have links to a map and also a scroll.  Some pages default to a map and others to a scroll, but in general all pages have both.

Pages like this need to be *hosted* on some kind of *web server*.  This can be on a free web hosting service, on a purchased domain with paid hosting, on a local wifi network only other people on that network can see, run locally on a single machine, or run on server clusters in decentralized Internet infrastructure as the network starts to scale up.

A word of warning: all Geometron servers are world-writeable and world-readable by default, with no user or login or password control.  Put nothing on any Geometron server which is private, personal or proprietary.  Do not integrate these pages into existing pages where you care about security.  The risks of a totally world-writeable and world-readable network go away if we put no money or property or personal information on the Network. And that is precisely how this Network is built: as a self-replicating shared art resource on which people can co-create art and instantly publish it both to the Web(both the centralized Web and the Geometron network).  If you want something to survive over time without being changed or deleted, copy it to places that won't get deleted like a local private hard drive, a Github repository or a pastebin paste.

What follows are some of the technical details of how to actually replicate this.  This part will be overly technical for people not used to working with the internals of Internet stuff.  If you ask around you can probably find someone who knows how to follow these instructions, though, and work together with them to build an instance of the Geometron Art Seed without digging into the very technical stuff yourself. Find someone into web things, sign both of you up for the mailing list and we'll get you set up with the more obscure details of making a new instance work.

<h3 style = "background-color:#ffbfbf">Technical Details Below This Line</h3>

[edit code with editor.php](editor.php)

All instances are replicated with a program called replicator.php, which uses a file called dna.txt to fetch all the files needed to run an instance.  These are a collection of html, javascript and php programs as well as some Geometron data which make up a copy of this whole webpage.  The entire system when copied is between 1 and 2 megabytes, and will run on any server with php installed, which is most servers.

The Github repository from all this is generated is:

[https://github.com/lafelabs/thing/](https://github.com/lafelabs/thing/)

To run the replicator, copy the code in [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/thing/master/php/replicator.txt) or use the [local copy of the file here](php/replicator.txt) to a file called replicator.php in whatever directory on the server you want to copy Geometron.  Run that file by pointing your browser to [your server url]/replicator.php, then click on the link you see.  After that you can click on the "fork" icon and navigate down to "symbol/" and click on that replicator as well to replicate the Geometron symbol creation page.

To start a new Geometron web server get free web hosting at [infinityfree.net](https://infinityfree.net/) or [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/) or buy a domain and get paid hosting at a company like [dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/), or get a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), install [Apache and php](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/apache.md) on it and do the same copying of replicator.php.  Build a Raspberry Pi terminal with a screen, keyboard, mouse and power supply(this can be bought as a kit or built up from a pi motherboard and found components from other systems), put it on a local WiFi network, figure out the IP address of it, and link to that from local networks to make physically local Geometron Page only available on local wifi. 

Here are the commands to install everything on the pi:

<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
</pre>

To get to web directory, copy replicator.php, run it, change permissions, and get your local IP address use the following commands from the terminal:
<pre>
cd /var/www/html
sudo rm index.html
sudo curl -o replicator.php https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/thing/master/php/replicator.txt
php replicator.php
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
hostname -I
</pre>

Once you have a IP address of a local server, put a link to that address on some global server so that without remembering the IP address or putting it in manually you can go to an existing server and just click to get to the local one.  If this is in a public place and you wish to share, you can then paint some physical thing with the address of the global page (www.yournewdomain.xyz), and edit the main top level scroll of that page to have the link to the local server be at the top, with some clear description or image(a picture of the physical server is not a bad idea).  

To set up a raspberry pi server, you can run it headless but you need a TV or monitor that has HDMI input with an HDMI, a mouse and a keyboard.

- [pi 4 b 40 dollars](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15446)
- [micro hdmi converter 6 dollars](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15796)
- [wall plug power for pi 4 8 dollars](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15448)
- [micro sd card, 16 gb, 20 dollars](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15051)

so to buy the whole pi server and set it up headless if you have basic computer stuff around like a screen, keyboard and mouse is about 75 dollars.  If you have to buy a screen, keyboard and mouse that probably adds 50 + 10 + 10 = about 70 dollars, then add a large lipo battery pack with usb c power cable for another 30-50 dollars or as high as 100 with a solar panel.  So the total cost for a fully portable system is in the range of 200 dollars.

 [robot.html](robot.html)

the robot needs a button added to "run" the python robot program.  this should be added in the same script as the off button(off button is on pin 3), both of which need to be run on boot, instructions for adding these are found here:

[https://howchoo.com/g/mwnlytk3zmm/how-to-add-a-power-button-to-your-raspberry-pi](https://howchoo.com/g/mwnlytk3zmm/how-to-add-a-power-button-to-your-raspberry-pi)

copying directly the instructions above works on GPIO 2 with the following code for the two programs that replace those used in that tutorial:

## listen-for-go-button.py:

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import subprocess


GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(2, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
while True:
	GPIO.wait_for_edge(2, GPIO.FALLING)
	subprocess.call('python /var/www/html/robot.py', shell=True)
</pre>

## listen-for-go-button.sh:

<pre>
#! /bin/sh

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          listen-for-go-button.py

The longer term road map for the Geometron Art Factory network is to install server clusters locally in every basement of every library, school, town hall, church, coffee shop and office park, locally owned by the people in that local community who get value from it.  Ultimately this can completely replace the centralized Internet, with physical hardware all controlled by the people who benefit from that network in the local physical world near those servers.

To create a new fork of the code, go to a UNIX command line with PHP installed, go into a new directory which is linked to a new github repository, copy replicator.php into that directory, run the program, then start php's built in web server as follows and type from the command line:

<pre>
curl -o replicator.php https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/thing/master/php/replicator.txt
php replicator.php
php -S localhost:8000
</pre>

 and navigate your browser to localhost:8000, then edit using editor.php, change references in replicator.php to your new repo address, and replicate from the new fork by changing the code in replicator.php.  Note that php code needs to be made live by cliking on txt2php.php from editor.php.  This will work on macos or linux with very minimal effort, and requires adding the Ubuntu command line or installation of [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) to work on Windows 10.  

Edit the code for any page using the *editor*, another thing all instances have:

[editor.php](editor.php)

When you have created your own modifications of the code, push that to your own Github repository and change the links in replicator.php to links to the global link to the raw text for your own dna.txt file and symbol/php/replicator.txt in your new repository and all future instances will be generated from your code instead of this instance.  Any php files you edit using editor must be converted from .txt to .php by running text2php.php by clicking on the link to that program from the Editor.  If you add new files, you can add them to dna.txt by clicking dnagenerator.php.  Note that *all* files in the system can be edited. 

To learn the skills needed to [hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) the code to your purposes, you need to learn JavaScript, HTML, and some PHP, all of which are best learned from [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/).

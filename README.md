# Geometron/ Trash Robot System

We seek to build a new civilization without mining, without money, and without property.  To do this we need to build technology to satisfy every human need as described in the [Trash Magic Manifesto.pdf](https://lafelabs.github.io/Trash_Magic_Manifesto.pdf)[[hardcopy](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/lafe-spietz/trash-magic-manifesto-and-action-coloring-book-revision-1/paperback/product-1km4deev.html)] entirely from either natural materials in our environment or from the waste streams of consumer society.

In order to begin this process we need an information technology system which is not owned by anyone and contains no property of any kind which can replicate the Trash Magic.  Trash Robot is a vehicle for Trash Magic. It is an "open brand", with a recognizable brand identity and design ethos which does not belong to any person or organization. 

Trash Robot is rainbows. Trash Robot is Googly Eyes. Trash Robot is geometry.  Trash robot is chaos.  Trash robot is a future without property, without money and without mining. Trash Robot is solid simple colors on a soft black background. Trash Robot is modular. Trash Robot is built partly from trash and partly from widely available off-the-shelf products which are easy to buy in small quantities, like duct tape or Raspberry Pi's.  Trash Robot production is not mass production, it is *craft* production.  

In Trash Robot the following laws hold:

- Everything can be replicated. 
- Everything can be edited.  
- Everything can be deleted. 

Trash Robot is a collection of things which we replicate. These are the elements of Trash Robot:

- [Raspberry Pi terminals](scrolls/terminal.md)
- [Domain names](scrolls/domains.md)
- [Code](scrolls/code.md)
- [Textile](scrolls/textile.md)
- [Skeletron](scrolls/skeletron.md)
- [Printers](scrolls/printer.md)
- [Shield](scrolls/shield.md)

- [Alchemy](scrolls/alchemy.md)

}

The text documents used for detailed descriptions of how to replicate things are called "[scrolls](scrolls/scrolls.md)".  [Maps](scrolls/maps.md) are a generalization of the meme or PowerPoint document.  They are combinations of links, text, images, and symbols arranged geometrically which can be used to organize any kind of information. They make it easy to link pages in our network together rapidly as well as to annotate images with symbols and words, which can prove essential in documenting technology we want to replicate.  Feeds are arrays of information without geometry like maps, just an ordering of elements.  They can represent any kind of information. The Image Feed is used to organize images from the Web which are used for making Maps as well as for tracing symbols into the Printer Robot software.

The [Geometron geometric meta-language](scrolls/geometron.md) is the basis of all symbols in our system. We use "symbol" in a maximally general sense to be *any* geometry with meaning.  This can include symbols like letters or pictographs, abstract symbols like arrows, machine-specific symbols like paths for cutting tools or lasers, geometric constructions in 3d, or even large scale architectural structures.  

[Terminals](scrolls/terminal.md) form a local media system by which users can create any document, replicate it, or edit it and share it with anyone else using the local network.  The most obvious use case is when people are sharing wifi networks anyway, such as in a home with multiple people or a coffee shop.  They are built for about 200 dollars, and are based on the Raspberry Pi pocket computer.  The Terminal acts as a web server, replacing the global Internet with a local network only visible over the local wifi but which can be replicated to the rest of the Web via the workflow described in the [code scroll](scrolls/code.md).

Physical machines and other infrastructure is built from trash and edited using the [Skeletron](scrolls/skeletron.md) system, which combines various craft methods to build things using the free and open brand identity of Trash Robot.  Trash Robot things are always rainbow colored with googley eyes.  They tend to have soft black backgrounds sharply contrasting with the rainbows.

Physical tokens are printed in clay using the [printer system](scrolls/printer.md).  Symbols are used to mean anything for any purpose. They can start as photographs of art or of real things or found images on the web.  They are then traced into Geometron code, which is used to operate the [printer robot](maps/printer) which prints the symbol into Sculpey polymer clay.  This first clay print is baked and put in an Earth Bag.  An impression is made of an Earth Token  or print to make a Stamp, or Fire Token.  A pair of Fire Tokens(or Stamps) are then used to impress symbols into the two sides of a Water Token.  These tokens are colored in with paint pen after baking.  The surfaces are then sanded down with a sanding block to remove the paint on the flat surface, leaving a colored symbol on each side of the final token.  Water Tokens can have holes punched in them with bent paper clips to enable them to be made into jewelry or mounted onto Boards and other objects such as clothing(sewn as buttons).  They are stored in a Water Bag.  They are also used on the Sigil Board as described in the [Skeletron Scroll](scrolls/skeletron.md) for meditative and [magical](scrolls/magic.md) practice.

The seed of technology beyond mere media is the Shield, a system for building on the Arduino which is the beginning of a wide range of technology which will eventually become the whole technologically complete set. For now it is a system where a novice can create some interesting and fun and potentially valuable machines.  These are documented in the [Shield Scroll](scrolls/shield.md).

We define "[magic](scrolls/magic.md)" in this work to be the replication of desire or the desire of replication. Our goal is to create technology which people replicate freely.  Our desire to replicate that is part of the thing we call "magic", and the other part is the replication of that desire itself. That is, someone other than us is transformed into a state of desire to replicate the set, replicating our own desire of replication. Magic is a form of recursion, as replication replicates itself ad infinitum if our technology successfully replicates.

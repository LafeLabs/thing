# Geometron/ Trash Robot System

We seek to build a new civilization without mining, without money, and without property.  To do this we need to build technology to satisfy every human need as described in the [Trash Magic Manifesto](https://lafelabs.github.io/Trash_Magic_Manifesto.pdf)([hardcopy](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/lafe-spietz/trash-magic-manifesto-and-action-coloring-book-revision-1/paperback/product-1km4deev.html)) entirely from either natural materials in our environment or from the waste streams of consumer society.

In order to begin this process we need an information technology system which is not owned by anyone and has no property on it which can be used to replicate the Trash Magic.  The IT system documented here is as close to free as we can build at this time, and replicates by providing enough value to users that they will benefit by building out more of the network without anyone owning the network as it grows.  

The system consists of the following elements:

- [Raspberry Pi terminals](scrolls/terminal.md)
- [Domain names connected to our physical locality][scrolls/domains.md]
- [This code repository, copied to your local machine, pushed to another repository](scrolls/code.md)
- [The textiles that make up the system(flags and bags)](scrolls/textile.md)
- [The Skeletron System of geometry](scrolls/skeletron.md)
- [Clay Printers](maps/printer.md)
- [Magic](scrolls/magic.md)
- [maps](scrolls/maps.md)
- [scrolls](scrolls/scrolls.md)
- [feeds](scrolls/feeds.md)
- [symbols](scrolls/symbol.md)

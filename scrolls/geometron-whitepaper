# Geometron

Geometron is a language for humans to control machines using the natural structure of both machine operation and the human mind.  We consider three structures to be fundamental to how our minds organize thought which are mirrored in machine operation.  Those are:

1. Cataloging or listing of things.  One of the most basic things we do when we organize information is make lists of things: the periodic table of elements, the alphabet, the organization of the base 10 number system, division of light into discrete colors, the system of organizing mailing addresses etc.   This is a structure mirrored in how modern computers are constructed: information is stored based on an addresses.  Addresses in a modern computer also often contain other addresses, direction the operation of the machine from one point in memory to another.   While arbitrarily complex and varied types of information can be stored at a memory address, it is useful in both machine architecture and human language to impose a structure which is universal across many specific elements.  For instance, the mailing address format can point to a vast estate, a PO box, an individual, a corporation, etc. but it's useful to have all these under the one unified system of addressing.  Another example of this is library call numbers, which map all of human knowledge to a simple string of numbers and letters.

2. Naming of things.  Perhaps the most fundamental form of abstract human language is using a word to point to a thing.  In particular the ability of the human mind to chain the naming process together is fundamental to human thought.  For example, we use names to point to people, but also use the word "person" to point to each individual person.  That is, words are used to point from any kind of thing to any other kind of thing.  The naming process creates complex networks of relations between things which we use to build up our whole view of the world.  As with the cataloging process, this function is mirrored in the architecture of our machines.  The languages we use to program machines are constantly using pieces of information, called variables, which represent some meaning separate from the name of that information.  For instance, in commonly used web software

# Geometron

The purpose of science and technology is maximize the ability of the human mind to interact with our physical environment.  As our society becomes increasingly technological, we find that our power in that society is based on our ability to control machines. As machines become increasingly complex, the groups of people able to control them become more and more specialized, and most people lose more and more control with each new more complex generation of machines.  In this work we seek to push back against this trend by building a language for the natural control of machines by people.  The intent here is to build not just a language but a linguistic framework which can be used in many context on many technologies for *all* people to wield more control over *all* machines.  By gearing the operation of the language directly toward industrial automation machines it is our intent to build a pathway for ordinary people across Humanity to have direct control of the means of industrial production at the local level.  

Geometron is a language for humans to control machines using the natural structure of both machine operation and the human mind.  We consider three structures to be fundamental to how our minds organize thought which are mirrored in machine operation.  Those are:

1. Cataloging or listing of things.  One of the most basic things we do when we organize information is make lists of things: the periodic table of elements, the alphabet, the organization of the base 10 number system, division of light into discrete colors, the system of organizing mailing addresses etc.   This is a structure mirrored in how modern computers are constructed: information is stored based on an addresses.  Addresses in a modern computer also often contain other addresses, direction the operation of the machine from one point in memory to another.   While arbitrarily complex and varied types of information can be stored at a memory address, it is useful in both machine architecture and human language to impose a structure which is universal across many specific elements.  For instance, the mailing address format can point to a vast estate, a PO box, an individual, a corporation, etc. but it's useful to have all these under the one unified system of addressing.  Another example of this is library call numbers, which map all of human knowledge to a simple string of numbers and letters.

2. Naming of things.  Perhaps the most fundamental form of abstract human language is using a word to point to a thing.  In particular the ability of the human mind to chain the naming process together is fundamental to human thought.  For example, we use names to point to people, but also use the word "person" to point to each individual person.  That is, words are used to point from any kind of thing to any other kind of thing.  The naming process creates complex networks of relations between things which we use to build up our whole view of the world.  As with the cataloging process, this function is mirrored in the architecture of our machines.  The languages we use to program machines are constantly using pieces of information, called variables, which represent some meaning separate from the name of that information.  For instance, in commonly used web software to have something called a "shopping cart" which is an abstract thing pointing to a list of things a person plans to buy.  In addition to information technology we consider the mappings which take place in machines where something like a pull on a steering wheel can map to a whole sequence of things, from a computer to power steering, to the many machines which respond in concert to such actions.  This is not exactly naming, but has a similar structure, where things are mapped to other things.  

3.  Geometry.  In this work we assume that certain types of geometry are fundamental to the structure of both human thought and to how all machines we build operate.  Most of the structure of the language presented here is based on either considering geometry which feels natural to the human mind like "left" and "right" and geometry natural to the operation of a machine like "distance between plants" in an agricultural robot or distance between pixels in a display.    

The Geometron language uses all three of these elements to construct a geometric meta-language: a language for building languages.  The language consists of geometric *actions* organized according to an addressing system called the Geometron Hypercube.  Each action is represented by a symbol which is itself drawn using the actions of Geometron.  

In order to build a language that is as natural as possible for people to understand we begin with what geometry we all consider natural and work from there to a specific implementation.  The most basic geometric action we consider are movement by one unit in the basic directions "forward", "backward", "left" and "right".  These words in human language have meanings which depend on context, and that is how they work in Geometron as well.  "Go forward" is a universal message which can be expressed in any human language, and yet its precise meaning depends on several unspoken assumptions.  There is an implied direction-state of the speaker or listener.  There is also an implied angle from which "left" and "right" deviate from "forward", and an implied unit which one might move.  For example if giving driving directions in a city on a grid, we might say "drive 10 blocks forward along the street you're on, turn right, and go 5 blocks, then left and one more block".  By abstracting this language we can generalize to something like "10 units forward, 5 units right, 1 unit forward" and this can apply to paces walked, pixels on a screen, or trees in an orchard.  That is, the idea of a grid of points which we navigate with simple lefts, rights, forwards, and backs, is a *universal* idea, which does not depend on special technical knowledge, but which we can expect anyone to understand even without written or technical language.  All this also implies that there is a position of the listener/speaker who is depicting this sequence of actions.  

To summarize the previous paragraph, we pose that there is a geometric "state" which all humans understand how to manipulate.  This state consists of position, orientation, a basic unit like "blocks", "feet", "steps", "football fields" etc, and an implied angle by which we turn(usually 90 degrees unless specified otherwise).  We can then create symbols to represent the basic operations of movement of this state as follows:

- go forward 1 unit
- go back 1 unit
- go left 1 unit
- go right 1 unit
- rotate left
- rotate right

We construct symbols for these which get as close as possible to using a universal language which all people will recognize, in this case arrows. These symbols are then:

These symbols are intended to be as universal as possible, avoiding both the selection of a language like English to draw from as well as machine-specific or technical mathematical language.  Each of these symbols is itself made up of geometric actions which will be documented below: changing of scales, rotations by various angles, and natural geometric constructions such as circles, arcs, line segments, and paths of joined segments.  We immediately see the power of building a language for creating symbols which is written in itself.  Just as human languages contain dictionaries consisting entirely of definitions written in the language being documented, we can create a language of geometric actions built entirely of symbols using those actions.  

This is the most fundamental power of the Geometron language: to make arbitrary symbols which can then be used to program all sorts of other more general machine operations.  Once we have the ability to make arbitrary symbols, we can immediately use those to construct commands for operating any machine.  For example, if we have a simple robot that simply consists of a stage that can be moved in two directions with a tool over the top of it, we can label one with a red arrow and one with a green arrow, select some basic movement unit, say 1/100th of the total span of the stage, and start writing programs by using a sequence of these arrow-motion actions.  In this language, a program that moves left on the red direction, then out in the green direction and back might look like this:

![](robot-movements-symbols.svg)

This simple concept can be very powerful when combined with direct controls of a machine.  A user who starts moving labelled levers to control a machine can immediately enter a sequence of actions based on the experience of operating that machine to automate a process.  This is the level at which automation can be truly controlled by the people of the world, and is a necessary condition for people to ever control their own means of automation.  

With the goal in mind of being able to build a universal symbolic language for controlling machines, we may now proceed to documenting how that language is constructed.  To reference the introduction here, there are three tools we will use: assigning addresses to things, assigning symbols to actions(in essence a naming of things), and the use of universal geometry of Nature.  When we speak of "actions" in Geometron it is useful to have some sort of object which is carrying out those actions.  That object is called the "Geometron Virtual Machine", or GVM.  Depending on context, the GVM might draw on a computer screen, control a robot, create 3d structures, control the function of buttons and keys, encode writing in human languages and edit the structure of Geoemtron itself. In all cases, each action has a symbol, which is itself just a sequence of actions.  Each action has an address which is made up of three numbers, each of which can range from 0 to 7.  Types of action are organized by the first of the three numbers(e.g. machine movements vs. 2d geometry vs. 3d actions etc.).  This system divides actions up into tablets which have an 8x8 array of "boxes" each of which maps to some kind of geometric action. The 8x8 array is an aesthetically pleasing way to organize information which pushes the bounds of what is comprehensible to look at for a person while also fitting the convenience of using powers of two for interaction with computers.  

Each action address is matched by a symbol address which adds a "1" to the left of the address.  All addresses start with a "0" to indicate the format as a Geometron address, and to indicate for computer code that this is a base 8 system.  Thus for example if the action for "draw a circle" is at address 0341, the address 01341 will contain the sequence of actions which draws the symbol representing the drawing of a circle.  This ability of Geometron to pivot meaning radically based on context mirrors the power of human language in contrast to most computer languages.  

The structure of addresses has its own geometry.  A stack of 8 tablets, each represented as an 8x8 array makes an 8x8x8 cube.  We have two of these cubes, the "action cube" and the "symbol cube".    Again while this might seem cumbersome and one can get lost in the details of the exact functions of addresses, this is intended to create large scale structures which anyone can understand: every action is a location in one of two cubes of 8x8x8 cells.  Ever action in the symbol cube consists of a sequence of actions which create the symbol representing the matching action in the action cube.  That is, each cell in the 8x8x8 symbol cube contains a sequence of addresses in the action cube.  

The action cube is divided into different types of function.  At this point the need to give the language enough specificity to actually function requires that we dive in in some depth to the exact functions used.  The address ranges in the Action Cube are as follows:

- 00-037: actions on the functioning of Geometron itself, such as moving a cursor, deleting a symbol, or clearing a symbol.  Taken together these types of action are called "root magic".
- 040-0176: ASCII.  These numbers correspond to the printable characters standard on computers in the English speaking world.  ASCII stands for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange" and is a universally recognized way to encode English characters on computers.  The contents of these addresses are used to map key functions on a keyboard to anything in the Geometron Hypercube.  For instance the address representing the letter lowercase 'a' is 0141, and in the default configuration that contains the address for "move forward by one unit", which is 0330.  So when a user strikes the 'a' key, that adds the action "move forward one unit" to the sequence being edited.  The symbols corresponding to these locations in the Action Cube are then symbols of the printable characters, which represent a font.  That is, for example, the address in the Symbol Cube corresponding to the lowercase letter 'a' is 01141. In the address 01141 in the Symbol cube we will find a sequence of actions describing how to draw a lowercase letter 'a'.  This creates an immediate way to handle all human languages and keyboard mappings, as we can simply edit the contents of the Geometron Hypercube to both change key functions and change all the printable characters in a set of 95 from space bar to tilde.

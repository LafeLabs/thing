## Installation

Open a terminal and install Apache and php:

<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
</pre>

Then install the [Geometron software](https://github.com/lafelabs/thing/) type copy/paste these commands into the terminal:

<pre>
cd /var/www/html
sudo rm index.html
sudo curl -o replicator.php https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/thing/master/php/replicator.txt
php replicator.php
cd ..
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
</pre>

Finally in order to have the buttons set up for if a Printer is attached we run the button setup script:


<pre>
sudo bash buttonsetup.sh
</pre>

and then turn the off button detector on:

<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/listen-for-shutdown.sh start
</pre>


Then hover the mouse over the wifi icon on the Pi desktop to see the IP address of your serer.  To operate the Trash Robot terminal either open a browser on the PI and open [http://localhost](http://localhost) or open a browser on any machine on the same local wifi network and point it to "http://[the ip address of your pi]".  Then you should be back in a familiar Trash Robot/ Geometron Dark Web space.

# Laser Cut Shapes

You can get laser cut shapes made from the files given here.  Here should be files for the basic 7 shapes in the shape set, the golden triangles, and the geometron ruler.  You can use geometron to make your own shapes. These shapes can be made into physical objects using typically 1/8 flouresent green acrylic cut out on a laser cutter.  You can find a laser cutter at any makers space and some artists have them.  The person who gave you Geometron can point you to someone with a laser cutter you can use probably, and you can send files to someone who can cut them out and drop them off in a geometron repository described using maps and symbol magic.  

To make your own, follow the separate geometron instructions for how to make a ruler and generalize from there.

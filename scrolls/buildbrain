# Build Robot Brain

First, get an assembled Robot Kit with the following components:

- [1 robot board from PCBWay.com](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Trash_Robot_main__brain__board.html)
- male straight headers
    - 4 pin, 3x
    - 6 pin, 1x
    - 8 pin, 2x
    - 10 pin, 1x
- 9 pin male right angle headers, 1x
- [MP6500 Potentiometer adjust, Pololu Robotics part number 2966](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/panasonic-electronic-components/EVQ-11L05R/P8079SCT-ND/259564)
- breadboard solid jumper wire, 0.6"
- 2 googly eyes
- duct tape of all colors
- corrugated cardboard
- cutouts of enclosure pattern

Solder the headers which go into the Arduino board by putting the headers in the Arduino, putting the pcb on them, and soldering all joints.  When done, remove board and pins from Arduino to enable further soldering.

solder the 9 pin right angle headers into place

Remove the Pololu boards from their bags if they are still in them, and use a pliers to carefully break the headers in the packages in two, so they are two 8 pin headers instead of one 16 pin header.

One by one, solder all three pololu boards into place by first placing the headers in the holes with the long pins pointed down, carefully double checking that the pins on the pololu boards match those on the main circuit board.  Pololu boards will have the writing pointed down, and the components including the adjustment potentiometers on the top.  

Solder into place the three 4 pin headers, being careful to make sure they are vertically aligned.  It can help to solder just one and then re-flow if needed to align, then go and finish the other three joints. 

Solder the 0.6 inch jumper on top of the board between the hole marked Vcc and the hole marked Vpower.

Remove excess wire from bottom of board where jumper extends below board with wire cutters

Re-assemble the board on the Arduino.  Plug the Arduino into a computer.  Use a tiny flat head screwdriver to rotate each potentiometer adjustment screw all the way counter clockwise.  Test the voltage between ground and the test point as shown on the Pololu Website to be sure that voltage is 0.1 volts, set for approximately 1/3rd of an amp.

Cut out shapes from corrugated cardboard based on patterns, tape assembly together with black duct tape, then use rainbow to create robot pattern, add googly eyes.  

Program robot with Trash Robot printer code using [program robot link](programarduino.html)

Test robot brain with existing controller and mechanical components all of which are already known to work.

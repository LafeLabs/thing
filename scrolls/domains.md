# Domains

Domains, like all elements of the System are not property. We "buy" them but they are not names of companies or people, but generic low-value names based on extremely specific geographic descriptions.  A good domain makes reference only to physical geography which is itself not owned, like public streets or names of local bodies of water. They are generally .net, .org or .xyz to avoid the commercial sounding .com.  

To start a new Trash Robot domain, buy a domain from [https://www.dreamhost.com/](https://www.dreamhost.com/) or [https://www.bluehost.com/](https://www.bluehost.com/) or someone similar, and get it fully hosted.  The create a new file in the web directory on the hosting service called replicator.php, and copy the code from the replicator found here: [php/replicator.txt](php/replicator.txt) into the new file, and save it. Point a web browser to [your domain name]/replicator.php, and wait. Click on the link.  This new page should be a live instance of the Trash Robot/Geometron system.  You can then build a local instance using a [Terminal](scrolls/terminal), push that to a globally visible github link, and replicate from there to the global server.

Once a domain has been purchased and set up with the Trash Robot software, we point the top level map of the domain to the IP address on the local network of the terminal on that network.  Power users can replicate from local networks onto their private laptops and then push that information to a global Git repository from which it can then be globally replicated across the entire Open Web.  See the [Code Scroll](scrolls/code.md) for more details.

Domains are then pointed to using a Flag as described in the [Textile Scroll](scrolls/textile.md).

# Civilization

The nature of our present civilization is one of constant consumption.  We mine or drill material out of the ground, re-shape it or burn it for fuel, and ultimately turn it into toxic waste we dump back into the environment.  During the process from mine to landfill, we exchange "money" and this is what we call the "economy".  The things which can be exchanged for money are called "property".

We seek to build a new civilization which is based not on a stream from mine to landfill, but on closed loops of material in equilibrium with living ecosystems.  We look to the technological civilizations of indigenous people as an example of what mature technology should look like. In mature civilizations, technology is all self-replicating. 

An example of technology in a mature civilization is traditional wooden boats.  If people live in equilibrium with a forest, as old trees die or are harvested new trees grow. People carve logs into boats, and then use them to hunt and sustain their communities.  A new generation of humans is born from the old, and they are taught all the skills to copy the construction of the boat, the stewardship and harvesting of the trees, and how to pass along the knowledge of boat building(as well as the hunting and fishing that sustains the whole society) to the next generation after them and so on.  Unlike a consumer civilization, this type of self-replicating organic technology can continue in theory indefinitely.  If it has the resilience built in to improve and change over time in response to changes in the ecosystem it can truly sustain itself without limits.  Mature civilizations like this have existed for thousands of years all over the Earth. 

Before stating what Geometron is and what it does, we have to examine exactly what "money" is and

# Feeds

A Feed is a sequence of elements.  The elements don't have geometric structure like a Map.  They can be text, links, symbols, or any other kind of media.  They are generally stored in the "[data](data/)" directory as JSON format files which end with ".txt" so that they can be read by humans in a browser.

The Feed is a general framework for building formats, but in the basic Trash Robot server we implement a few versions.

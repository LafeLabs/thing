# Printer

This is how to build the Trash Robot printer of clay tablets, also known as coins.  This assumes you already have a [Trash Robot Terminal](scrolls/terminal) built.  

The printer plugs into the Raspberry Pi 40 pin connector on the Terminal.  It requires a separate power supply either from the wall or a battery, generally the same type of rechargeable 12 volt battery suggested for the terminal in that scroll.  

The needed parts to build a Printer are:

- 3 DVD drives or CD drives
- 3 [MP6500 stepper motor control boards from Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/product/2966)
- 3 buttons
- [40 pin raspberry pi GPIO ribbon cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JQ5MG42/)
- [40 pin pi header](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756KM7CY/)
- wires to connect buttons to the board with some distance between them
- lots of corrugated cardboard and duct tape, [the basic duct tape and cardboard fabrication system of Trash Robot](scrolls/box)
- Stiff plastic for the bridge tool arms, such as 1/16th inch polypropelyne, of the kind used to make plastic storage totes
- thin transluscent HDPE plastic of the kind used for milk bottles
- custom trash robot circuit board which can be ordered from PCBway or made by any board shop
- a little stack of rare earth magnets and a nail
- a barrel connector to connect the 12 volt power to the circuit board 
- 12 V rechargeable battery as with the terminal, along with wall charger and splitter for it

Tools needed are:

- soldering iron and solder
- wire cutters and wire strippers
- multimeter which can measure resistance
- general trash robot cardboard fabrication kit from [box](scrolls/box)
- screw drivers of various sizes to take apart the DVD drives
- tiny flat head screw driver to adjust the potentiometers on the motor control boards

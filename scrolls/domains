# Domains

Domains, like all elements of the System are not property. We "buy" them but they are not names of companies or people, but generic low-value names based on extremely specific geographic descriptions.

To start a new Trash Robot domain, buy a domain from [https://www.dreamhost.com/](https://www.dreamhost.com/) or [https://www.bluehost.com/](https://www.bluehost.com/) or someone similar, and get it fully hosted.  The create a new file in the web directory on the hosting service called replicator.php, and copy the code from the replicator found here: [php/replicator.txt](php/replicator.txt) into the new file, and save it. Point a web browser to [your domain name]/replicator.php, and wait. Click on the link.  This new page should be a live instance of the Trash Robot/Geometron system.  You can then build a local instance using a [Terminal](scrolls/terminal), push that to a globally visible github link, and replicate from there to the global server.

# Symbols

The generalized symbol: any geometry with meaning.  This includes microprocessors, circuit boards, building architecture, city layout, periodic structures in agriculture, letters, icons, brands, glyphs, body movements.  Geometric action can be pixels, classical geometry constructions

GVM in the maximally abstract sense as a virtual machine which carries out geometric actions to create symbols.  The GVM operates on a sequence of addresses in the Hypercube.  Show what a Hypercube is in the most abstract sense without a specific hardware or software, show making the vesica piscis with a set of operations and addresses, show the geometry of hypercube, discuss how both human language and computer code can be encoded in ASCII which means every element of the Hypercube is entirely a sequence of addresses in the Hypercube since ASCII is a subset of the Hypercube.

Machine control for automation, discuss how we can use geometric abstractions to create something which can instantly port to many different hardware and software and sizes.  Talk about: 
 - clay printing, print domain name, icons
 - trash printing with heated tool, use to print domain name
 - wall spray paint robot, describe how to build, use to spray domains and icons(brands)
 - agricultural automation robot
 - electron beam lithography
 - electrochemical probe manipulation
 - cardboard cutout tool

# Code

There are five basic types of code used in the Geometron System, corresponding to five Alchemy archetypes.  These are:

- Air: CSS
- Water: HTML
- Fire:JavaScript
- Earth:Geometron Hypercube
- Aether:PHP

Geometron is [documented here](scrolls/geometron.md).  The other four can all be learned from [W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/), using [Mozilla's documentation of web developer technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [https://www.php.net/](https://www.php.net/) as a reference for PHP. 

All code self-replicates. 

All code is human readable.

All code can be edited by all users.

All code can be deleted by all users.

All code can be copied by all users.

The initial location of the Trash Robot/Geometron Thing code is at [https://github.com/lafelabs/thing/](https://github.com/lafelabs/thing/). 

To create another instance of the full Trash Robot/Geometron system, we copy a program called "replicator.php" into the main web directory of the server.  The raw code can be found at either locally on this server at [php/replicator.txt](php/replicator.txt) or globally on the original lafelabs Github "thing" repository at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/thing/master/php/replicator.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/thing/master/php/replicator.txt).  

We generally Trash Robot/Geometron in one of three ways:  

1. We run it on a Raspberry Pi and serve it over a local wifi network.
2. We

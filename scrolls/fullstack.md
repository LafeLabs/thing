# Full Stack Geometron

flaws in existing system

computers are not computers

geometric processing

hybrid circuit fabrication technology

clay and slimezistor as building block

the full geometron processor architecture:

 - image stack, physical storage media, retrieval and recording methods
 - geometron hypercubes and GVM, physical storage media for hypercubes
 - various stacks: letter stack, image stack symbol stack, etc.
 - clockless operation, physical screen control
 - scroll format, physical implementation
 - hybrid architecture in block diagrams
 - pointers to how to build the ab initio fab and how to reverse engineer and integrate trash
 - communal portals with huge display, where the machine is the size of a full size skeletron hut, full immersion in the unit greater than 2 meters in size
 - full integration into closed loops to control entropy over time in a world without microfab
 - the use of geometron to control the automation technology used to write data, read data, fabricate circuits, and do all other things needed for a civilization to function

# Trash Robot dot Org

Dig it up, set it on fire, and bury it.  This is our civilization in a nutshell.  The way to break this cycles is to build technology which is both made from waste streams and which can manufacture products using waste streams.  Trash Robot is a robot built from trash which is programmed to print patterns in clay. We program it using Geometron, a symbolic language based on geometry and designed to make it simpler for non-experts to control machines while avoiding numbers and code.  Together we, the people of Trash Robot, will give FREE robots to every artist, student, or maker in the world.
 
I am asking YOU to join this movement now and scale Trash Robot to the whole world!

We need:

- makers to build robots
- students to learn the robots and use them to fabricate things
- teachers to learn to teach the robot system and share it with students
- librarians to distribute the robots
- researchers to improve the robot and extend what it can do
- donors to donate materials to keep the flow of free robots going

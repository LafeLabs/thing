Get a blob of Sculpey clay, flatten it out to be about a quarter of an inch thick and an inch and a half around in a circle. Print using the [Printer](scrolls/printer).  Bake for 15 minutes at 275F.  Allow to harden after the oven, and to get to room temperature. 

Use the print to make a stamp by pressing another ball of clay into the print hard enough to go into the impression from the printer:

From print to stamp and from stamp to tablet. print one symbol on each side, cut off flat with a blade of some kind, push holes in big enough for two trash ties, push all ridges down smooth by hand, and bake.

Sand the top layer of paint off, leaving only the pixels with paint in them:

Repeat, make many coins.  Thread them on Trash Ties.  Use to transmit symbolic capital through the Trash Magic economy:

Use [shapes](scrolls/shapes) and Tape Snake and Trash Tie from [skeletron](scrolls/skeletron) to make board. Rainbow tape, googly eyes, geometric patterns.  Put the icon coins on the boards.  Board is used to arrange icon coins in patterns of conceptual relation to play around with how the information relates to itself, so the [magician](scrolls/magic) can better control the system.

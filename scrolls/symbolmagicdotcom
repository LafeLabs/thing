# Symbol Magic

### Magic: the replication of desire

### Symbol: geometry with meaning

To *cast* a symbol magic coin, choose a magic(desire to replicate) and two symbols, and email your design to <a href = "mailto:coins@symbolmagic.com">coins@symbolmagic.com</a>.  Coins will then be *minted* on the Geometron/Trash Robot printer and mailed to you.  You can then *invoke* the symbol magic by exchanging the coin with other people.

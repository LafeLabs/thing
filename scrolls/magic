Magic is the replication of desire, and the desire of replication.  

Sets are collections of objects in the most general possible sense.  Anything of any kind which can be identified by human language can be called an "object" for our purposes.

Set Magic is the replication of a set which includes the desire to replicate the set.  

Symbol Magic is the creation of self-replicating symbols which point to their own replication.  Symbols in their most general sense are geometry with meaning.  That geometry can be encoded in anything.  So symbols include all fabrication technology and crafts of all kinds.  All technology can be considered a subset of symbol creation.  All technology and craft is geometry with meaning to the creators of the things.

Trash Magic is the use of magical practice to build a Technological Complete Set as defined in the Trash Magic Manifesto.  

The Trash Robot is a specific self-replicating set, which self documents.  It is what is documented here.

Trash Robot can be used to cast Set Magic.  To do that the magic practitioner chooses a set they desire to replicate, and then decides how to parse that set into objects.  They then map those objects to icons encoded in the language of the Trash Robot clay printer.  In order to do that they first sketch out what they're looking for in a notebook, in either words or crude depictions of the desired icons.  They then either find images on the Web, copy and paste their url and put them in the global image feed or they find an object, photograph it, and upload it to a local Geometron server.

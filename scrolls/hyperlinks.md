# Hyperlinks

What is the point of networking? It is to link things.  This is the most fundamental service we will provide to the world with the Organic Web: linking things to other things.   We use the term "hyperlink" to refer to any kind of linking from one thing to another, by whatever means are available.  Connections are the basis of everything people do.  When people share, give, take, sell, buy, create, help, join or collaborate, we need first to connect.  

To make this specific, this generally means one a few things:

 - A software link to a document which can be shared via text message or email or clicked on in a document
 - A QR code which can be scanned by a mobile device which connects to a software link
 - Physical media pointing to a domain
 - Documents pointing to physical things/places/people/times

This sounds abstract.  It is abstract in order to have the maximum possible generality, but is mostly just a fancy way of describing almost all kinds of communication people might want to do in order to go about their lives.  An advertisement is a hyperlink, in that it links the viewer with whoever places the ad.  A sign in front of a shop is a hyperlink to the inside of the shop.  A document explaining how to make a thing is a hyperlink to a replication of that thing.  A document with a sequence of linked memes which describe how to get to a certain place at a certain time where a web server will be on a certain network is a hyperlink to that server.  A business card is a hyperlink.  A resume is a hyperlink.  A network in which riders are matched with drivers is a network of hyperlinks between riders, drivers, destinations, and pickup locations.

# Trash Robot

No more mines.  We will build a fully automated civilization from the waste streams of the extraction-based one we live in now.  Right now Trash Robot is made partly from trash and partly from some DIY electronics we have to buy.  Join the swarm! Spread the word! Share the idea that we can build *everything* from trash using this robotics platform, and we will get enough people and resources to make it happen. 

Trash Robot prints coins. Copy the robot to print the coins.  Tell people about our ideas and share the coins with them, asking them to support our network.  The more people support our network the more people we can tell about it.  The more people know, the more the robot will be copied, and the more it is copied the faster it will evolve.  We will evolve it with intention: to first build a full network stack, both hardware and software which is built *entirely* from upcycled components, and then to use that to build a full technology stack with all needed elements for a good life based on the maker platform built into Trash Robot.

Just as we are not just a meat sack and some neurons, Trash Robot is not just computer parts and motors and gears.  Trash Robot is a living thing, which has characteristics which contain its essence, just as corporate brands or collective identities of humans do.  Trash Robot is an identity which contains many objects and technologies but is more than just those.  

The parts of Trash Robot which best express its essence are the ideas and ethos behind it.  These are the idea of a society in which rather than value being "stored" in the form of money, property, land, and mineral hoards, value is *replicated* via self-replicating media.  

Thus the most valuable things are not those which "contain" the most value in a static sense but rather those which replicate the most effectively, and where that replication has the most use to the most people.  In order to replicate we need it to be easy, simple, and recognizable.  

We also want to be attention grabbing and somewhat outrageous.  Finally, we want to not overlap existing "property" in the form of widely used symbols or corporate logos.  

The Trash Robot Avatar is a rainbow with googly eyes and a black rectangle for a mouth.  This can be made of any material, and of any size.  It can be physical or digital. 

The Trash Robot Font is used for all big signs in the physical world. It is shown below cut out of felt.  Operators cut these out of felt to spell out in all caps "TRASH ROBOT" and sews it to  pants as well as the Trash Cloth.  Shirts are made by making a trash robot avatar out of strips and circles of felt, sewing it all together, then sewing it to the front of the shirt.  An Operator will wear both the pants and the shirt and hold a Sign which points to a Domain. 

Trash Robot is also a self replicating set.

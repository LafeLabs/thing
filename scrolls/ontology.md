# Ontology

1. the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being.
2. a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.

We consider things in the most abstract sense.  From things we create sets, which are also things.  This section is a more formal mathematical treatment of the material in the "magic" chapter.  It is more technical than that chapter, and does not reference magic, but does reference our specific implementation. 

This is where the Theory of Self replicating sets is described. We point to the failures of the project of set theory in the 20th century, how it was a dead end, and how we can navigate out of the dead end by placing the mathematicians ourselves in the sets we describe. The whole failure of the old models of self replicating machines(perhaps this gets moved back to organic media chapter).

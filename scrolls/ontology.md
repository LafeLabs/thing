# Ontology

1. the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being.
2. a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them.

We consider things in the most abstract sense.  From things we create sets, which are also things.  This section is a more formal mathematical treatment of the material in the "magic" chapter.  It is more technical than that chapter, and does not reference magic, but does reference our specific implementation. 

example things:

The Geometron Terminal

The Pyramids

Audion

ArtBox

Trash Robot Icon Printer

Skeletron

laser cut shape set

laser cut ruler

custom laser cut shapes and stencils

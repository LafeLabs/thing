# Alchemy

In alchemy we use archetypes of the five elements to replicate a thing.  

Think of a thing you desire to replicate.  Now break that thing into a set of elements. Some of those elements can themselves be sets of elements which have further elements.  For instance Trash Robot is a set which includes Skeletron which is a set which includes Trash Poles. 

 For each element of your set, think of a symbol. For each symbol you either find it on the web and put it in the global image feed or upload it to the Trash Robot Raspberry Pi server.  This collection of images of symbols is the "Air" elemental(yellow triangle with line). 

 We then use the aligner and tracer programs to convert each symbol into Geometron Hypercube code.  These are all saved to the Icon Feed.  This sequence of Geometron glyphs, the Iconfeed, is the "Aether" elemental(Purple Hexagram). The program page can then be used to create the code which runs on the Arduino Brain of the Trash Robot Icon Printer. 

The Printer is used to print out each symbol in clay, both sides can be used. Clay is baked and placed in an Earth Bag, as this set of Prints represents the "Earth" elemental(green triangle with line).  

These are used to make clay stamps which represent the "Fire" elemental.  This set is put in a Fire bag(red triangle).  

Finally pairs of stamps are used to stamp out the final Icon Token.  This is where another layer of meaning can be created by which symbols we choose to pair.  A good pairing is symbols of things with a subset relationship. For instance in the Trash Robot Set, one token has a textile symbol on one side and bag symbol on the other.  These represent the Water elemenental(blue triangle). A full set is placed in a Water Bag for carrying around and using.  These symbols can now be used for anything in the service of increasing ones focus on the Set.  

This is the path of Alchemy using Trash Robot and the Geometron language to do Trash Magic: We focus our attention on the replication of a thing by following the path above.

# Book of Shapes

Take the existing Book of Shapes and the Shape Set that came with it, and replicate the book.  The book will describe how to replicate itself using the cut shapes.  You should get a blank book, a book which is filled out but not colored in and acrylic shapes.  Color in the one book, make another that is not colored in, and another blank one.  Pass the blank book and the filled out but not colored book as well as the laser cut shapes along to the next user in the Geometron network.  Drop the colored completed book off in a library or book box.

# Intro Video Script

Dig it up[image of mine], set it on fire[image of gas blowoff from refinery], and bury it[image of landfill].  This is our civilization in a nutshell.  The way to break this cycle is to build technology which is both made from waste streams and which can manufacture products using waste streams.  Trash Robot is a robot built from trash which is programmed to print patterns in clay.  We program it using Geometron, a symbolic language based on geometry and designed to make it simpler for non-experts to control machines while avoiding numbers and code.  Together we, the people of Trash Robot, will give FREE robots to every artist, student, crafter or maker in the world who wants to help build a world of abundance.

Trash Robot in its current form is a tool which moves a nail on some magnets using scavenged computer parts, cardboard, plastic, and duct tape[show components in order as still images: nail on magnets, plastic tool bridge, cardboard stacks, full system].  The nail moves like the needle on a tattoo gun, poking into the clay to make patterns. These patterns can be used to make art pieces but also to fabricate real technology by casting other materials into the molds made from clay.

We need students to learn and operate the machines[still image of robot and a clay print], hobbyists to assemble the kits into finished robots[still image of a kit and still image of assembled unit], teachers to share the skills to use them with students[icon of a growing network of nodes, arrows and dots], donors to contribute materials[logos of suppliers, dollar signs], scavengers to find trash to use[stack of DVD drives, stripped and not stripped], developers to improve the technology[screen of code], and librarians to accept donations and physically distribute the kits, materials and robots and coordinate the network[images of maker spaces at libraries].  If you are interested in filling any of these roles, see specific instructions and join us to build a better world. [flash the url]

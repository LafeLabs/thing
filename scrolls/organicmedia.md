- everything replicates
- everything evolves
- everything dies

- no money
- no mining
- no property

path of replication: how to install and how to teach others to install, how to replicate the code, replicate specific files, how it's all structured, editing the code itself

Editing: how files work, how they don't work. No databases. no private data. No file that cannot be edited.

Deletion: cheap sd cards can be wiped any time.  All files can be deleted or written over by anyone at any time.  Domains are chosen to be of no real value, are disposed of as soon as burned, never sold.  Evaluate entropy of domain names to prove we can always have zero value of names even as our network grows exponentially.  "Permanent" deletion less critical in a world without private or personal data.

Cybersecurity: there is none. Security is for private property, and there simply is none on this network.  This network must always be disconnected from the property-based Internet or private systems.  One way paths of information for protection.

File types independent of technology: symbols, feeds, maps, scrolls.  These can be described without any specific implementation of *either* software *or* hardware.  Specific implementations will be dealt with in their own sections.

How files are structured, overview of file types, what they do.

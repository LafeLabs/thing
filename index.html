HTML = HyperText Markup Language


       to learn html, go to https://www.w3schools.com/ and follow the html tutorial.  Learn HTML, CSS, javascript, and basic php.  Together with geometron these are the Five Elements of geometron code:
       
       Earth: Geometron
       Water: HTML
       Fire: Javascript
       Air: CSS
       Aether: PHP or other server-side code such as python
   
   comments do nothing, and are encapsulated by dashes, angle brackets and an exclamation mark as seen in this comment, and should be blue like this.

<h1 id = "ipaddress"></h2>

<h1>Geometron</h1><!-- h1, h2, h3 etc represent headings of decreasing size as the numbers go up.  "elements" refer to anything in an html document  -->
<p><!-- p means paragraph, and makes a newline on the screen -->

<!-- links are denoted by an "a" meaning "anchor", with the destination of the link in the "href" field and what gets displayed going between the open tag <a> and closing tag </a>: -->    

    <a href = "scroll.html">scroll.html</a>

<!--

copy and paste the link code to add your own new link, then go back to index.html to see the change.

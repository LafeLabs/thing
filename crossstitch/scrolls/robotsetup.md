4. point another device on the network to the IP address of your robot server and navigate to [ip address]/robot.html
5. delete any glyph which is already in memory
6. enter an arrow to the left, right, up and down and forward and back as a test without the tool mounted
7. turn on the battery
8. reload the browser to make sure your new glyph is in memory
9. run the program by pushing the "GO" button. if it doesn't work, ask for help. at this point the stages should all move in turn
10. mount the tool holder
11. mount the tool on the tool holder
12. add a soft clay tablet to print

14. make a test print of a line, horizontal, then vertical, then a square test pattern
15. play around and make some more simple lines

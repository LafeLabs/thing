Emailed to ask about buying the stage by itself, 6/13/20.  If this can be shipped with the cable already on it, and with just the sage, no optics, and no drawer or box, and if it were standardized, there could be zero labor in assembly, and total cost for a set should be under 10 dollars in modest amounts.  

Bill of materials for full kit

- linear stages, 3 , 3 or 4 dollars each, $8-$16 with cables 
- cut pieces of HDPE < $1
- cut pieces of thicker plastic < $1
- stages, cardboard replacement part--cardboard? $1
- cut pieces of foam with puzzle pieces, branding to hold stages < $1
- magnets $1
- nails(selection) < $1
- pi hat board, with full pcba, no potentiometers, MP6500 chip, headers, buttons $8-$15
- 12 V battery, wall plug, cable $25

 15 + 1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 + 12 + 25 = $58 for electronics and mechanicals 

- pi board $35
- SD card $2
- pi wall power supply $5
- enclosure and heat sink for pie and hat $5

$47 Pi setup

Craft stuff $7

- roll of duct tape $1
- pack of sculpey $6


Labor cost is based on setting up the raspberry pi and testing each unit, then packing them and shipping them. 10 per hour at 36 dollars per hour, rounding up is $4 labor, call it 5 to be safe


So $58 for robot kit, $47 for pi kit, $7 for craft supplies, $5 labor means TOTAL kit cost is 58 + 54 = $112, so the target for MSRP is 4x that, or $336 to $450. 

Or if the kit is sold without the pi setup or battery stuff, JUST the custom kit stuff can be $60 x 3-4 is $180 to $240.

Full kit target MSRP is $399 with everything working, tested, ready to go, with a little craft kit and branding.

For a crowd fund, the kits could range from early bird and stripped down at cost of $75 to $600 with a Zoom call.  Aim for 1000 units in first run, so with an average price of $300, that's 300k.  Minimum could be in range of 1/3 that to not lose money, or $100k.  Target $25k.  Sell online kits first to get some traction, use that to launch crowd fund for bulk orders.  

Can I make and sell kits online using existing technology?  If I do it all myself and don't value my labor, the current kits can be about $100 in materials with no economies of scale.  I could sell the trash kits for $200, buying all the components on ebay.  Give away 1 for every 5 sold, sell with online ads, just try to break even and get traction.  Initially try to get back investment, by selling 25 units at $200 to get back 5k or so of investment.   Kits are free if you do a video, crowd source the videos. Or rather if you do video you get a free extra kit after the video.  

Keep APL salary up to level of not losing money.  Only goals of business in phase 1 are to not loose any money beyond what i've already spent(get back money from initial orders), pay for prototypes of real kit, buy time to get exact prototypes and suppliers lined up and get enough traction to do a crowd fund with a public target of $10k and a private target of $300k.  With a $300k crowd fund, phase 3 is to make distribution and promotion deals with larger companies, partner with Sculpey, Crayola, etc., aim for distribution in major retailers like Target, scaling up to a few million dollars a year in sales.

Phase 1. Get a minimum viable product kit which costs $100 with my own free labor to make and sell for $200, sell enough to not lose money on it, on Etsy, just to get traction, and improve the product, work out the bugs, and buy time to get a real scalable kit built which can be the basis of the crowd fund.

Phase 2. Do a crowd fund on a complete kit with an MSRP of $399, with a public target of 10k but private target of $200k-$300k.  Leverage the crowd fund into getting attention of larger companies for...

Phase 3. Make deals with larger companies like Crayola and Sculpey to get them to promote and bring into mass market retail at the global level

very relevant example company to compare to:

Other business possibilities for geomtron in a similar vein are laser cutter, electron beam lithography tool, laser cut shapes and book.  The Etsy/crowd fund path makes sense for the shapes and book as well.  Sell the book on Etsy.  Sell the kits on Etsy.  Sell the postcards and triangles.  Build community on Etsy, test what works, break even, then go to crowd fund and making larger partnership deals to scale.

# Elements of Code

Geometron code is divided into five elements:

- Earth: Geometron
- Air: CSS
- Water: HTML
- Fire: JavaScript
- Aether: PHP


These are just concepts, ways of thinking of things--they are not to be taken literally.

The Geometron geometric language is the language used to create all the vector graphics in the system.  CSS, also known as Cascaded Style Sheets, is how web page style is determined(fonts, colors, layout etc).  HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the basic language in which all web content is written, and describes elements of a document like "paragraph", "image", "heading" etc.  JavaScript is the language of actions which take place in the web browser.  PHP or PHP Hypertext Processor, also known as "Personal Home Page", along with Python are the languages used to communicate with the Geometron server.

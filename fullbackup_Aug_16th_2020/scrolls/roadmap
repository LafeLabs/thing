# Geometron System Roadmap

## Long term goals

- fully mobile first system with mobile apps on the android and apple store
- encode CJK characters in geometron with a system of building radicals from strokes and characters from radicals
- braille printer
- fix bugs in the curved closed path code
- physical distribution network of robots, servers, shapes, books, other technology and media
- circuit fabrication with clay
- fully upcycled system with old broken phones, computer equipment and other standard electronics integrated into a replacement for the raspberry pi
- build a system of physical media flows via industrial production outside of the property system, where all input materials are upcycled and output materials are owned by no one
- hack existing 3d printers for direct trajectory control with geometron
- write books in a proper book format documenting the whole system 
- cuneiform printer
- metal fabrication with a probe in an electrolyte with electroplating
- electron beam lithography with geometron
- AFM/STM control with geometron
- construct new stepper motors from scratch out of sticks and salvaged magnets and coils for large scale stepper motors in robotic probes on the meter scale
- construct energy storage system for the system from aluminum/carbon battery cycle, charged with a dynamo driven by water or air power
- replace standard operating system with a geometron system that directly controls pixels in screens without running a standard OS or "computer", no clock.  It's just stimulus, response, all running on the geometron virtual machine
- integrate clay tablet printing system with electronics to store geometron data permanently in clay, read it out optically with direct pixel access to CCD cameras, and load into a fully geometron based geometric processor
- build an economic system whereby physical media are produced in local production facilities outside of the private property system, which are used to create value for the local population, who then barter with the operators of the system to allow us to live outside the system of property, use this to create media factories for many places and people and groups.  This system will be totally local.  We will create local physical media, use it to advertise itself, then use it to advertise locally to create value for locals who will help us locally.

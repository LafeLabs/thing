# Organic Media
  
- everything replicates
- everything evolves
- everything dies

- no money
- no mining
- no property

path of replication: how to install and how to teach others to install, how to replicate the code, replicate specific files, how it's all structured, editing the code itself

the structure of sign pointing to domain which points to terminal which is near a place which is labelled by domain(this needs to get explained early since it will be the referenced in everything, as  it's basic to the structure of the System)

Editing: how files work, how they don't work. No databases. no private data. No file that cannot be edited.

Deletion: cheap sd cards can be wiped any time.  All files can be deleted or written over by anyone at any time.  Domains are chosen to be of no real value, are disposed of as soon as burned, never sold.  Evaluate entropy of domain names to prove we can always have zero value of names even as our network grows exponentially.  "Permanent" deletion less critical in a world without private or personal data.

Cybersecurity: there is none. Security is for private property, and there simply is none on this network.  This network must always be disconnected from the property-based Internet or private systems.  One way paths of information for protection.

draw from the SRS paper and the existing organic media paper(but the formal SRS idea goes in ontology chapter)


File types independent of technology: symbols, feeds, maps, scrolls.  These can be described without any specific implementation of *either* software *or* hardware.  Specific implementations will be dealt with in their own sections.

How files are structured, overview of file types, what they do.  All of this is as a generalized specification which users can use to rewrite from scratch quickly.

Example of physical organic media: The Art Box, replicator card, replicator shape, object itself, scroll

We will return to the Art Box again and again as we go through the system, illustrating how it can replicate in the Geometron system and how it fits into all the parts: symbols in "symbols" for the shapes and net, the set in ontology, maps, feeds, scrolls, scroll replicator, role in magic as one of the Trash Robot avatar objects

The user page, basic operation of Geometron as it exists today, just viewing now editing, but with pointers to editors, jump on and look at a file RIGHT NOW, on one of my pages.

In organic media chapter we introduce geometron and say what we're going to be doing in this book.  What we are doing is providing a *specification* and an *example* of an instance of that spec. We will use the Pi, and remote hosted pages.  But expect this spec to be used by many coders on many platforms in many ways if successful.

# install

# php localhost

create a directory to put the system in, go into it and type:
<pre>
curl -o replicator.php http://trashrobot.org/php/replicator.txt
php replicator.php
php -S localhost:80
</pre>

Then when the local server is started, open a browser on that same machine and point it to localhost/

Now you should see the system and be able to interact with it and edit it from a browser.  

This assumes PHP is installed, which it will be if you're on mac, and if it's not you can install it.  If you're on windows, install the Ubuntu package from the microsoft store to run it under windows without a dual boot.

# Hosted domain

Just copy the replicator to a file called replicator.php with copy/paste from [http://www.trashrobot.org/php/replicator.txt](http://www.trashrobot.org/php/replicator.txt) and point a browser to [your domain]/replicator.php, wait for the files to be copied, and click the link to go to the system.

# Raspberry Pi or DIY linux server:

Install php and apache:

<pre>
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
</pre>

Now to run under apache, go to the web directory, copy the trash robot replicator and run it, and set fully anarchist permissions -R 0777 *.

<pre>
cd /var/www/html
sudo rm index.html
sudo curl -o replicator.php https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LafeLabs/thing/master/php/replicator.txt
php replicator.php
cd ..
sudo chmod -R 0777 *
</pre>


# Editing and forking

all code is edited via editor.php which is linked from the tools map.  Explore the tools.  Look at the code. Change it and see what happens.  Nuke it and re-install if you want any time you don't like it.  To fork, push your local code you're editing to some globally visible host via git, and then you can replicate the code from there to any server on the Web by changing the URL in the code in replicator.php.  Explore all the tools.  Things are not really documented, they are buggy and chaotic.  But they replicate and replication is enough, that is the basis of life.

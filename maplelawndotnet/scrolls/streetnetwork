# Trash Robot/ Geometron Street Network

Me, now, here.  [https://www.maplelawn.net](https://www.maplelawn.net)

The [Terminal](scrolls/terminal.md) is a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) with a keyboard, mouse, display and power supply, which run a web server only visible over the local wifi network.  It is carried by the Operator, who uses it to help users create, edit, copy, and share files over the local network.  

The files on the Network can be:
 - [Scrolls](scrolls/scrolls.md). These are a type of text file which uses the [Markdown markup language](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for formatting.  
 - [Feeds](scrolls/feeds.md). Feeds are either a directory with a sequence of files a user can scroll through and select or an array of any kind of information, be it images, symbols, words, links, etc.
 - [Maps](scrolls/maps.md). A map is a sort of generalized meme, like a PowerPoint or Keynote slide.  It is an array of elements each of which has a position, angle, width, possibly an image url, some text, and possibly a link destination, which might be either a HTML hyperlink or an internal link to a file on the system 

All users on the same wifi network as the Terminal can view, edit, delete, and copy all the files on the system.  There are no user names, no logins, no passwords, no private data, and no databases.  

Users can all see all files, edit them, delete them, copy/paste them, create new ones

Operators carry the Terminal around, share its link with people, talk to people about the system, teach users to use the system, help to share with new Operators. 

Roles of the Operator: 

- the keeper of the physical Terminal
- maintain relationships with users of the Terminal and Domain
- update the Geometron server at the hosted Domain with links to the IP address on the local wifi network of the Terminal, as well as the wifi network name and password or link to where to get it(e.g. coffee shop register)
- post ads for money or barter on the Geometron server at the  hosted Domain for people who ask
- post on the global Geometron server when and where the Operator will appear, or where the terminal is set up on what network if it's installed permanently.
- Teach anyone who wants to learn how to be an Operator, recruit new Operators
- Tell new users about the Network, teach them to use it, how to post, edit, delete
- Promote any kind of business or other venture or project anyone physically local to the wifi network area has in exchange for barter with that user for useful things on location(including just a place to operate)
- Spread Network into new places by finding a location with a wifi network, buying a domain and setting up hosting or getting someone to do that and pay for it,
- Domain names spread in physical space using physical media with depiction of domain which points back to terminal ip address, wifi address and password, photo of terminal and operator other physical media(post cards, book marks, spray paint stencils), spreading the physical media with the domain name

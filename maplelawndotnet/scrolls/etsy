Preamble: 

Trash Magic will build a world beyond mining, beyond property, and beyond money.  By "magic" we mean the replication of the desire to replicate a thing. We build things people want, and which they want to share.  This replication of desire to replicate is what we call "magic".  Geometry is the unifying factor.  Trash Robot and Geometron form the framework for this work.

We use materials from consumer waste steams to build useful products which are able to be repaired and improved indefinitely, giving them an effectively infinite lifetime if people can learn the skills to repair them.  This removes energy from the mine-to-landfill pipeline, undermining that system.

We build things which freely replicate, which contain within them the means to communicate their replication to other people, so they can replicate with no central control whatsoever.  This creates value which is not property, removing energy from the property system.

Our value system is based on the geometry of things, rather than a numerical value.  Things are made using well documented steps of geometric construction, and that geometry itself is the medium which is exchanged in the "economy", rather than numerical prices.  This creation of value outside of money, which can freely grow without money, moves our productive activities beyond the money system, undermining the third leg of capitalism.

## Icon Token Set in Water Bag

This is the alchemy of Trash Robot, form of Alchemy:

Think of a thing.  A desire or intent. Now break that thing up into a set elements.  Assign a symbol to each of those elements. A Trash Magician can take that set of symbols, map them to Geometron code, express that in clay with the Trash Robot Token Printer, make stamps from the prints, then stamp out sets of Tokens which are painted and sanded and put in a Water Bag.  That bag is carried around and used to focus ones mind on the original thing from the beginning of casting the Trash Magic.

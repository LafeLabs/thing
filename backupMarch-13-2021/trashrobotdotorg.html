    <h1>Trash Robot</h1>


<p>
  Dig it up, set it on fire, and bury it. This is our civilization in a nutshell. The way to break this cycle is to build technology which is both made from waste streams and which can manufacture products using waste streams. Trash Robot is a robot built from trash which is programmed to print patterns in clay. We program it using Geometron, a symbolic language based on geometry and designed to make it simpler for non-experts to control machines while avoiding numbers and code. Together we, the people of Trash Robot, will give FREE robots to every artist, student, or maker in the world.
</p>
<p>
We are asking YOU to join this movement now and scale Trash Robot to the whole world!

<h2 id = "librarians">Librarians</h2>

<p>
    Librarians!! you are the connectors that link this network together. You already serve a role in communities across the world to share information and resources locally across all ages and sections of society. You can treat this like any other programming that would normally be part of a makerspace or other STEAM education and outreach you might have.   More specifically we need you to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
     Store kits in the library maker spaces for distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reach out to populations under-served by normal STEAM education programs to give them free robots.
    </li>
    <li>
    Add trash robot to educational programming for the library, to help bring library patrons in as artists, students, and hobbyists.  Teachers in the network can be called upon to lead classes in how to set it and run it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Take donations from donors, be the tax deductible non profit or guide donors to one which will allow them both to buy components and donate surplus equipment(namely DVD and CD drives)
    </li>
    <li>
    Serve as a trusted intermediary between parents, hobbyists, donors, and teachers. For safety reasons it makes sense for parents to trust public libraries as a resource for free information and materials, and providing that sense of security is important. Donors need to know they're contributing to a real organization as well if they're to trust that a donation will end up at the right place.        
    </li>
    <li>
        Help spread the word to the rest of the library community
    </li>
    <li>
    If you run a "little free library" that counts! You can use that as a place out of the rain where people can leave and take parts for kits, fully assembled robots, and completed clay tablets to share with the community.    
    </li>
    <li>
        University libraries have similar roles to play to other libraries, but what we hope for from them in Trash Robot is that public study lounges can serve as a place where robot materials can be shared. If this has the support of library staff, who can help find volunteers to run a robot production zone in a study lounge, it can be very useful.
    </li>
</ul>
    
<h2 id = "makers">Makers</h2>

<p>Trash Robot is a totally decentralized industrial production swarm. For this to work we need to build a vast network of people with the knowhow to replicate the whole system. We need people with crafting skills(cardboard and plastic trash) and basic electronics assembly(simple soldering), as well as people who like to take things apart and scavenge for parts.  If you are one of these but not the others, you can form a network to build collaboratively(cardboard crafters can find electronics builders and vice versa).  
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Build robots!</li>
    <li>Teach others to build robots</li>
    <li>Share kits with other makers</li>
    <li>Reach out to librarians and teachers to donate robots that can get directly to kids</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "students">Students and Artists</h2>
<p>
    Students and artists! You are the operators who make the final product of the whole Trash Robot system. What you can do is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Find someone to give you a robot and get it set up(teacher, librarian, or maker)</li>
    <li>Make your own symbols and share them with others, build a culture of remixing the art made with Trash Robot</li>
    <li>Make finished clay tablets from Sculpey and distribute, exchange, display or sell them</li>
    <li>Learn to build robots yourself and become a maker</li>
    <li>Learn to teach others how to set up the system and become a teacher</li>
    <li>Learn the Geometron language and use it to make new fonts, symbolic systems, and apps to share with others</li>
    <li>Make custom unique gift items for others using the clay tablet fabrication</li>
</ul>


<h2 id = "teachers">Teachers</h2>
<p>
    Teachers play a critical role in the expansion and development of the Trash Robot/Geometron network. Teachers can be staff or administrators at educational non-profits, after school programs, university faculty, or any person who is willing to share these methods outside existing systems. This program should be largely self-guided but teachers can help make curriculum specific to many demographics of students.  More specifically we are asking you to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Take existing media and re-target it for specific age groups, demographics, languages, then publish that media to the rest of the Network</li>
    <li>Build networks with Librarians and Makers to distribute kits to your students</li>
    <li>Tell other teachers about Trash Robot</li>
    <li>Write grants to get funding to develop Trash Robot curriculum and get support from donors to buy kits to supply the network</li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "scientists">Scientists</h2>
<p>
Trash Robot/Geometron for now are largely in the category of "STEAM education".  But the long term plan for the system is to be a platform for generalized industrial production.  The purpose of printing in clay is that this can be used as the basis for many types of fabrication. Some of the things we need to get working as soon a possible are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Figure out a process that scales to extract usable clay from riverbeds and fire it in home-made mini-kilns.
    </li>
    <li>Develop robust processes for printing in plastic and metal by making clay molds and pouring plastic and metal in</li>
    <li>Build a heated tool and/or heated bed for printing in low melting point materials like chocolate and wax</li>
    <li>
    Figure out a process for casting circuits into clay that avoids solder balling up and not connecting: some kind of copper and solder and flux slurry.  Use this to make interconnects on up-cycled circuit boards.
    </li>
    <li>
    With an electrode on the metal tool in an electrolyte figure out how to do 3d metal fabrication in solution with rastered electroplating.
    </li>
    <li>
    Use the probe to somehow 3d print in collagen
    </li>
    <li>
    Develop bottom up nonlinear circuits: gates, diodes, amplifiers using organic materials in fluidic channels by making channels in clay and putting organic slime in them, experiment with clay chemistry, doping the clay, embedding metal etc.
    </li>
    <li>Develop a robust and mature clay technology literature focused on transformative manufacturing of found clay and found materials from industrial waste streams</li>
    <li>
    Develop fluidics fabrication in soft materials for lab-on-chip applications
    </li>
    <li>
    Control the beam in an electron microscope for geometron-driven electron beam lithography and other nano tools like AFM/STM/FIB.
    </li>
    <li>
    Use levers to reduce the motion of the standard trash robot tool to go to lower scale, try to get 1 micron precision, and use for long term data storage in clay.
    </li>
    <li>Close all the loops: our ultimate goal is a system which has ONLY parts which are sourced from waste streams, including the energy storage(carbon/aluminum trash batteries), energy generation(salvaged motors running wind and water power) and computing(bottom-up Geometron processors)</li>
    <li>
        Write research grants to support further development of the system.
    </li>
</ul>



<h2 id = "developers">Developers</h2>
<p>
What makes Trash Robot as powerful as it is, the real heart of what makes it different is the Geometron language.  This is a fundamentally new way for humans to interact with machines, where all interaction is driven by geometry and symbols.  The initial system was written by one person, alone, and is pretty simple.  We need developers willing to learn the entire Geometron stack and extend this to something that can really scale.  "Developer" is used loosely here to mean anyone with any interest in or willingness to learn any kind of programming at all even if you have no experience.  Geometron is not like other languages and is much easier for artists to learn than traditional "code".  Specifically some of what we need from developers is:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make this web page look better</li>
    <li>Clean up JavaScript to make it more efficient</li>
    <li>Clean up all the CSS in the system to make it all look better</li>
    <li>Make sure all the various pages in the Geometron system are optimized for accessibility.</li>
    <li>Make the main trash robot interface better on mobile</li>
    <li>Make Geometron apps that can go in the app store</li>
    <li>Extend Geometron to build up CJK characters from strokes and radicals</li>
    <li>Build a cuneiform printer</li>
    <li>Improve all documentation</li>
    <li>Build frameworks that are more professional that allow developers to quickly deploy Geometron for use across the web without learning too much special skills</li>
    <li>Delve deeper into the hardware control, building a clockless Geometron processor which directly write vector graphics to the pixels of displays without using a traditional processor</li>
    <li>Close the Geometron data loop by building a system for encoding Geometron bytecode into arrays of rectangles called Roctal which can be printed in clay and then read by a camera on a device, directly controlling a Geometron processor without any traditional computing being used.</li>
    <li>Build systems for replacing all commercial parts with found parts, notable by porting the system to obsolete and broken Android phones and Internet routers or other broken or obsolete IoT devices</li>
    <li>Formalize the applied math and computer science of the Geometron Hypercube and Geometron Virtual Machine, publish papers on them in the academic literature and online</li>
    <li>Collaborate on building reference books to document at a professional level the entire Geometron system</li>
    <li>Build a *nix distribution specifically for Geometron which strips down the OS to the bare minimum needed to run it</li>
    <li>
    Apply the geometron language to trajectories in Hilbert space for programming quantum computers.  Contact author for details. 
    </li>
    <li>
    Generalize Geoemetron to 3d, to build a system of computer aided 3d design.(a prototype exists, ask about it.)
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id = "donors">Donors</h2>
<p>
This network will need resources to grow. Those resources will come from people who are willing to donate what they have access to in order to further the growth of the whole system. By working with educational non profits like libraries and schools, we will build an ecosystem of institutions which can take fully tax-deductible donations of both surplus materials like old computer parts and newly purchased materials like electronics parts and art supplies.  This is decentralized.  There is no foundation here that's asking for money, you just find a library or school, email the right person, tell them about Trash Robot and ask to donate and volunteer there.  In many cases a "donor" can just be someone willing to save their milk cartons, wash them out and drop them off at a school, or to spend a few dollars on some small parts.  Specifically what we are asking for from donors are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Buy all the parts in the Electronics Kit and donate them to a maker space, library or school.</li>
    <li>Donate any computer hardware that might have DVD/CD drives in it</li>
    <li>Donate art and tech supplies like markers, scissors, box cutters, rulers, glue, epoxy, soldering irons, solder, volt meters</li>
    <li>Tap your network of other people who might want to donate to the cause</li>
    <li>Reach out to teachers, makers, librarians, and students to find people interested in serving in those roles, and then work with them to donate to the network to help it grow</li>
    <li>Ask everyone you know if they have any extra Raspberry Pi's they are not using or any Raspberry Pi related accessories which can be donated and connect them with the right school, library or non profit</li>
    <li>Buy and donate Raspberry Pi's and related gear</li>
    <li>For larger donations, work to fund grants which can be paid out to educational and research non profits to fund both the expansion of the network and the research and development which will improve it and expand its scope</li>
    <li>See the description of how to build a robot to get details on what is needed</li>
</ul>

    The first version of this uses one very simple board from Pcbway which can be under 1 dollar in bulk and all the rest are off the shelf boards and components. If a hobby electronics company like Pcbway, pololu, sparkfun or adafruit wanted to they could make a much nicer pre-packaged solution and sell it in bulk, and we encourage them to do so.  It is important that the current version remain as a baseline so that we never rely on any one supplier but it would also very much help growth of the system if one or more company were to sell a kit.  All work here is in the Public Domain and manufacturers can make and sell kits for profit with no restrictions or licenses whatsoever.  You make it, you promote it you keep the money, and the more efficiently you do that the more our network grows, which is the only thing that matters for Trash Robot/Geometron.  Contact the author of this page for details, or just remix the linked board in the assembly instructions as you see fit(the design is trivial).
